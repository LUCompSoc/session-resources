# Build your own HTTP Server

In this session, you build your own HTTP server.
You can follow along with the [slides](http://slides.compsoc.io/2023_24/week_1/advanced/),
or use the example files to get started.

We recommend downloading [`lib.py`](./lib.py) as it provides utilities for interfacing with the underlying TCP socket.
