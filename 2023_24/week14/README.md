# Clippy Goes Rogue : How to F**k Up a Discord Bot

We messed up a Discord bot so you don't have to.

The webhook url no longer exists, so you'll need to replace it with your own.

1) Start with [simple bot](./simple_bot.js), to bark when you run the script.
2) [Dog bot](./dog_bot.js) will introduce you to some canine friends.
3) Try deploying [cloud bot](./cloud_bot.js) cloudflare.
4) Realise that search engine crawlers are driving your pooch mad, and replace it with [guard bot](./guarded_bot.js).
